* read config dirs:
    the idea is to be able to compose configurations using config.d directories
* add a set of default config paths where to look for a config file:
    similar to file but check first for common location, e.g. /etc.. /home/.config/...
* dont fail if config path does not exist ( option to make config file optional/mandatory)
* allow multiple files to be overlaid

* in the options option to specifi a file as key value and have that loaded
    e.g. to load a secret from file

* add validation rules using annotations
